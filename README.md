## 🤖 AllureIQ – AI-Powered API Automation Framework  
My own **AI Automation Framework** that replaces traditional RestAssured setups with **self-learning test intelligence**.  
Built with **Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Allure**, AllureIQ learns from execution history, generates summaries, and identifies recurring issues automatically.

**💡 Core Highlights**
- ⚙️ 5× Faster Debugging — AI-driven error identification  
- 🔁 Reusable Test Modules — Plug-and-play framework for any API  
- 🧠 AI Intelligence — Smart summaries and recurring error patterns  
- 📊 Unified Allure Reports — Centralized analytics with MongoDB integration  
- ☁️ Deployed on Render — Public access to real-time AI summaries  

**🧱 Architecture Overview**
```
[Test Execution] → [AI Analyzer] → [MongoDB Logs]
        ↓                     ↓
[AI Summary Engine] → [Allure Reports → Spring Boot Portal]
```

**🧩 Tech Stack:**  
Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Allure, TestNG, Custom AI Logic
